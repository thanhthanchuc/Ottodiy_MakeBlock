# Libraries
A purpose of this repository is to discuss and document properly the Otto libraries for Arduino IDE.

## Installation:
How do I setup the Arduino IDE and libraries? or How to install the libraries (not Otto specific) ?
Answer: "There are multiple ways to add libraries to your Arduino IDE after installed the most easy for me is to just Download all the libraries from the files tab for the specific project and move them to C:\Users\user\Documents\Arduino\libraries (or wherever your libraries folder was installed)
Other ways use .zip installation through menu or even automatic updates online(i wish i knew how to do this for Otto) but i never need to do it this way, is a very general topic that all new Arduino users face and there is a lot information by just googling.

## Compatibility:
Otto Core Libraries is the code to be deployed to the user's Documents\Arduino\libraries directory, including: BatReader, EnableInterrupt, MaxMatrix, Oscillator, Otto, OttoSerialCommand
Different and similar versions of Otto Core Libraries are currently included in multiple repositories and sub-projects:

Robot  | Library can use
------------- | -------------
DIY | Otto9
DIY+  | Otto9
Humanoid  | Otto9Humanoid
Q (Quad) | Quad
X(explorer)  | Otto9
R (Rover)  | Otto9
W (Wheels)  | Otto9

To resolve the need to maintain so many different deployments/versions here in this centralized repository, in order to maintin consistency along the Otto remixes we stablished a naming structure: 
Otto_(followed by the component name and version) for example:

* Otto9 contains all the main functions and is the version 9
* Otto_gestures9 contains all the gestures functions
* Otto_mouth9	contains all the mouth functions
* Otto_sound9 contains all the sound functions
* Otto_Matrix9 contains all the matrix functions

Complementary libraries like Ultrasound, Interrupts and BatReader are independent of Otto(they can work with other projects) therefore are just named like they are, for example:
* US contains the functions of the ultrasound
* Bat Reader contains the functions to meassure the battery.
* Adafruit_NeoPixel external library from Adafruit to control NeoPixel LEDs
 
 ## Wirings and Electornic diagrams:
We will follow these standard connections
SERVOS:
PIN_YL 2 left leg
PIN_YR 3 right leg
PIN_RL 4 left foot
PIN_RR 5 right foot
PIN_LA 6 Left arm if enabled
PIN_RA 7 Right arm if enabled

ULTRASONIC:
PIN_Trigger  8  //TRIGGER pin (8)
#PIN_Echo    9  //ECHO pin (9)

BUZZER:
PIN_Buzzer  13 //BUZZER pin (13)

SOUND SENSOR:
PIN_NoiseSensor A6  //SOUND SENSOR   ANALOG pin (A6)
 
LED MATRIX:

DIN_PIN    A3   //DIN pin (A3)
CS_PIN     A2   //CS pin (A2)
CLK_PIN    A1   //CLK pin (A1)
LED_DIRECTION  1// LED MATRIX CONNECTOR position (orientation) 1 = top 2 = bottom 3 = left 4 = right  DEFAULT = 1

BATTERY SENSE:
boolean BATTcheck = true;    // SET TO FALSE IF NOT USING THIS OPTION
PIN_Battery   A7  //3.7V BATTERY MONITOR   ANALOG pin (A7)

TOUCH SENSOR or PUSH BUTTON 
PIN_Button   A0 // TOUCH SENSOR Pin (A0) PULL DOWN RESISTOR MAYBE REQUIRED to stop false interrupts (interrupt PIN)

RGB NEOPIXEL LED:
boolean enableRGB = true;    // SET TO FALSE IF NOT USING THIS OPTION
NeopixelRGB_PIN  12 // NEOPIXEL pin   DIGITAL PIN (12)
NUMPIXELS 1   // change for more than 1, becarefull with the current

SERVO ASSEMBLY:
to help assemble Otto's feet and legs - wire link between GND and pin 7 for PLUS & pin 10 for humanoid
#define PIN_ASSEMBLY 10   //ASSEMBLY pin (10) LOW = assembly    HIGH  = normal operation
